# FNBench
The initial version of official codes for our paper [FNBench: Benchmarking Robust Federated Learning against Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06684). It serves as a benchmark platform for researchers to evaluate robust federated learning algorithms against noisy labels. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me: )

## Datasets
For vision tasks, we use CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10-N, CIFAR-100-N, and one large-scale online clothing datasets Clothing1M for evaluation. 
For language tasks, we use AGNews for evaluation.
We list a table as below:

| Dataset | Model | #Classes | #Train Set | #Test Set | Label Noise Pattern | Extra Information  |
| :-----: | :------: | :------: | :--------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :----------------: |
| CIFAR-10 | ResNet-18 |   10    |   50,000   |   10,000  | Synthetic | -  |
| CIFAR-100| ResNet-32 |   100   |   50,000   |   10,000  | Synthetic | -  |
| AGNews |   FastText | 4     |  120,000  |   7,600  | Synthetic | [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset)  |
| CIFAR-10-N| ResNet-18 |  10 |   50,000   |   10,000  |  Human Annotation Errors | [link](https://github.com/UCSC-REAL/cifar-10-100n)  |
| CIFAR-100-N | ResNet-32 | 100  |   50,000   |   10,000  | Human Annotation Errors  | [link](https://github.com/UCSC-REAL/cifar-10-100n)  |
| Clothing1M| ResNet-50 |  14 | 1,000,000  |   10,000 | Systematic Errors | [link](https://github.com/Cysu/noisy_label)  |


For the last three datasets, considering related copyrights, please refer to the corresponding links for dataset requisition. Meanwhile, we provide an implementation code to experiment on `Clothing1M` in this [codebase](https://github.com/Sprinter1999/Clothing1M_FedAvg).

## Baselines

- **General FL methods**: FedAvg, FedProx, FedExP
- **Robust FL methods**: TrimmedMean, Krum, Median, RFA
- **General Noisy Label Learning (NLL) methods**: Co-teaching, Co-teaching+, SymmetricCE, SELFIE, Joint Optim, DivideMix
- **Federated Nosy Label Learning (FNLL) methods**: RobustFL, FedLSR, FedNoRo, [FedRN](https://github.com/ElvinKim/FedRN), FedELCï¼ŒFedELR

For FedELR re-implementation, please kindly refer to [the original paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=4995227) since it has no official implementation. We also provide one implementation of one new work [MaskedOptim](https://github.com/Sprinter1999/MaskedOptim).


## Example for Usage
> bash eval_fedavg.sh

please refer to the `./utils/options.py` for more details. For CIFAR-N experiments, please use another two main files (like main_fed_LNL_cifar10N.py). We recommend you to experiment on Nvidia 3090 (24G) GPUS or more advanced GPUs.
